A lightweight QR card built with semantic HTML and responsive CSS to match the Frontend Mentor design.

## Overview

- Pixel-perfect layout for desktop and mobile breakpoints
- Reusable utility classes for spacing, typography, and colors
- Accessible markup with logical heading order and alt text
- Deployed preview hosted on GitHub Pages (update link once live)

## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yousef-Gaber11/frontend-mentor-projects.git
cd qr-code-component
```

Open `index.html` in your browser or use an extension such as Live Server for hot reload.

## Project Structure

```qr-code-component/
├── images/           # Optimized assets
├── design/           # Reference JPGs
├── style-guide.md    # Colors, fonts, layout specs
├── styles.css        # Component styles
└── index.html
```

## Deployment

1. Build or adjust assets if needed.
2. Commit and push to `main`.
3. Enable GitHub Pages (root directory) or deploy through Vercel/Netlify.

## Lessons Learned

- Tight control of spacing via CSS variables simplifies fine-tuning.
- Using `max-width` on the card plus `min-height: 100vh` on the container keeps the component centered across viewports.
