```

## Lessons learned

- Leveraged `flex-direction: column` and `gap` to keep the vertical rhythm consistent.
- Used CSS custom properties to centralize colors and spacing for easier tweaks.

## Continued development

- Investigate using CSS Container Queries once browser support stabilizes.
- Add light/dark theme toggle driven by the `prefers-color-scheme` media query.
